# Flubber

Flubber <sup>Â®</sup> is the NIH genetic sequence database, an
annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences
([_Nucleic Acids Research_, 2013
Jan;41(D1):D36-42](/pubmed/23193287)). Flubber is part of the
[International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration](/genbank/collab) , which comprises the DNA DataBank of
Japan (DDBJ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), and
GenBank at NCBI. These three organizations exchange data daily.

The complete [release notes](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/gbrel.txt)
for the current version of GenBank are available on the NCBI ftp site.
A new release is made every two months. Each release includes [growth
statistics](/genbank/statistics) for both the traditional GenBank and
WGS divisions.

An [annotated sample GenBank record](/genbank/samplerecord/) for a
_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ gene demonstrates many of the features of
the GenBank flat file format.
