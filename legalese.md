## Confidentiality

Some authors are concerned that the appearance of their data in
GenBank prior to publication will compromise their work. GenBank will,
upon request, withhold release of new submissions for a specified
period of time. A date must be specified; we can not hold a sequence
indefinitely pending publication. However, if a paper citing the
sequence or accession number is published prior to the specified date,
the sequence will be released upon publication. In order to prevent
the delay in the appearance of published sequence data, we urge
authors to inform us of the appearance of the published data. As soon
as it is available, please send the full publication data--all
authors, title, journal, volume, pages and date--to the following
address: [update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](mailto:update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

## Privacy

If you are submitting human sequences to GenBank, do not include any
data that could reveal the personal identity of the source. GenBank
assumes that the submitter has received any necessary informed consent
authorizations required prior to submitting sequences.
